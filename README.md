Due to web technologies in constant change, and the growing popular use of Front End technologies such as **Backbone**, **Ember** and **AngujarJS**, the need for server side MVC frameworks that render HTML templates has become increasingly obsolete, and API endpoints to get data from has become a major need.

The idea behind **API Handler** is to make it simple to develop API endpoints throught PHP. You define some Getters, Posters, Deleters and that's it. API Handler does all the heavylifting (Database queries, identify resources, encode to json or xml and output).

Please refer to http://zorrodg.github.io/php_apihandler/ for full documentation.

Enjoy! :)
